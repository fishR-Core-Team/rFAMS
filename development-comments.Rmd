## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Adding Pieces to the Package
1. Code a single function and save it as an R script in the R folder. itsname <- function(stuff)
2. Use use_r() to create/open a script and call use_test() to create a matching test file.
3. To test, use library(devtools) and load_all() to make these subfunctions available, then use them directly
4. Check without leaving R Session with check().
5. Run R CMD check when ready.
