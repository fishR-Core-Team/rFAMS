# FAMS
Fisheries Analysis and Modeling Simulator
## Purpose
To recreate and expand/improve upon the FAMS/FAST software functionality for equilibrium and dynamic pool models, utilizing existing fishR and FSA components whereever possible
## Status
Just starting to code!
## Process 
### Equilibrium Modeling
1. Evaluate steps in the analysis.
2. Determine whether any steps need updating in analytical approach to be current with fisheries science.
3. Determine whether any steps need expanding upon to better incorporate current fisheries science.
4. Begin coding, concurrently documenting and establishing error and validation tests.
