Description: Simulates the dynamics of exploited fish populations using the Jones modification of the Beverton-Holt 
             equilibrium yield equation to compute yield-per-recruit and dynamic pool models (Ricker 1975) 
             <https://publications.gc.ca/site/eng/480738/publication.html>. 
             Allows users to evaluate minimum, slot, and inverted length limits on exploited fisheries using 
             specified life history parameters. Users can simulate population under a variety of conditional fishing mortality 
             and conditional natural mortality. Calculated quantities include number of fish harvested and dying naturally, 
             mean weight and length of fish harvested, number of fish that reach specified lengths of interest, total number 
             of fish and biomass in the population, and stock density indices.
