\arguments{
\item{Linf}{A single numeric that represents the point estimate of asymptotic mean length from the von Bertalanffy growth model OR an \code{nls} object created from fitting the von Bertalanffy equation to length-at-age data.}

\item{K}{A single numeric that represents the point estimate of the Brody growth coefficient from the von Bertalanffy growth model.}

\item{t0}{A single numeric that represents the point estimate of the x-intercept (i.e., theoretical age at a mean length of 0) from the von Bertalanffy growth model.}

\item{FLR}{A single character to indicate the fecundity-length relationship; either "linear" or "log10".}

\item{FLRint}{A single numeric that represents the intercept of the fecundity-length relationship.}

\item{FLRslope}{A single numeric that represents the slope of the fecundity-length relationship.}

\item{MatAge}{A single integer that represents the age at maturity.}

\item{percF}{A numeric vector representing the percentage of females at each age, starting at age-1.}

\item{percFSpawn}{A numeric vector representing the percentage of spawning females at each age, starting at age-1.}

\item{M}{A single numeric that represents natural mortality.}

\item{F}{A single numeric that represents fishing mortality.}

\item{MUnder}{A single numeric that represents natural mortality under the slot limit.}

\item{MIn}{A single numeric that represents natural mortality within the slot limit.}

\item{MAbove}{A single numeric that represents natural mortality above the slot limit.}

\item{FUnder}{A single numeric that represents fishing mortality under the slot limit.}

\item{FIn}{A single numeric that represents fishing mortality within the slot limit.}

\item{FAbove}{A single numeric that represents fishing mortality above the slot limit.}

\item{tmax}{A single numeric that represents the maximum age of fish.}

\item{slot}{A boolean indicating if a slot limit is used (TRUE) or if a minmium length limit is used (FALSE)}

\item{minLL}{A single numeric that represents the minimum length limit for harvestable size}

\item{recruitmentTL}{A single numeric that represents the total length (mm) fish are recruited to the fishery (i.e., will be harvested)}

\item{lowerSL}{A single numeric that represents the total length (mm) of the lower limit of the slot limit}

\item{upperSL}{A single numeric that represents the total length (mm) of the upper limits of the slot limit}

\description{
Calculates the static spawning potential ratio with the yield-per-recruit model
}
\details{
This function is generally not used independently. It is called when requesting the spawning potential ratio while calculating yield-per-recruit.
