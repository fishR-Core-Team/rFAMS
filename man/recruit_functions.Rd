\title{Generate a vector of recruitment abundance for the dynamic pool model.}
\usage{
fixedRec(simyears = 50, Nrec = 1000)

unifRec(simyears = 50, MinR = 10, MaxR = 1000)

rnormRec(simyears = 50, meanR = 1000, sdR = 500, MinR = 100, MaxR = 2500)

StrYC_Nth(simyears = 50, meanR = 1000, Nthyr = 5, sizeStr = 2)

StrYC_randInt(simyears = 50, meanR = 1000, avgFreq = 5, sizeStr = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{simyears}{A single numeric that sets the number of years to simulate recruitment}

\item{Nrec}{A single numeric that sets the fixed number of recruitment}

\item{MinR}{A single numeric that sets the minimum recruitment abundance during simulations.}

\item{MaxR}{A single numeric that sets the maximum recruitment abundance during simulations.}

\item{meanR}{A single numeric that sets the mean recruitment abundance.}

\item{sdR}{A single numeric that sets the standard deviation of recruitment abundance}

\item{Nthyr}{A single numeric that sets the Nth year that a strong year class will occur}

\item{sizeStr}{A single numeric that sets the multiplier for the strong year class relative to meanR}

\item{avgFreq}{A single numeric that sets the average frequency of a strong year class.}
}
\value{
A named list that contains the given reproduction options that can be used directly in the yield-per-recruit calculation functions (e.g., \code{\link{yprBH_SlotLL}}).
}
\description{
These function is used to generate recruitment abundances across multiple years using different random function.
}
\details{
This function is used internally and not generally used interactively
