\title{Function to calculate transitional spawning potential ratio}
\usage{
t_spr(dproutput = NULL, SPRdat = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dproutput}{A dataframe containing outupt from the dynamic pool model}

\item{SPRdat}{A named list that contains values for each \code{FLR}, \code{FLRint}, \code{FLRslope}, \code{MatAge}, \code{percF}, and \code{percFSpawn}. See \code{\link{makeSPR}} for definitions of these parameters. Also see details.}
}
\description{
Calculates the unweighted and weighted transitional spawning potential ratio with the dynamic pool model
}
\details{
This function is generally not used independently. It is called when requesting the spawning potential ratio while calculating yield-per-recruit.
