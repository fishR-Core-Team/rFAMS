\arguments{
\item{minLL}{A single numeric representing the minimum length limit for harvest in mm.}

\item{cf}{A single numeric representing conditional fishing mortality.}

\item{cm}{A single numeric representing conditional natural mortality.}

\item{N0}{A single numeric representing the initial number of fish in the population OR a vector or list that contains named values for each \code{N0}, \code{Linf}, \code{K}, \code{t0}, \code{LWalpha}, \code{LWbeta}, and \code{maxage}. See examples.}

\item{Linf}{A single numeric representing the point estimate of the asymptotic mean length (L-infinity) from the von Bertalanffy growth model in mm. May be given in a named vector or list given to \code{N0} (see examples).}

\item{K}{A single numeric representing the point estimate of the Brody growth coefficient from the von Bertalanffy growth model. May be given in a named vector or list given to \code{N0} (see examples).}

\item{t0}{A single numeric representing the point estimate of the x-intercept (i.e., theoretical age at a mean length of 0) from the von Bertalanffy growth model. May be given in a named vector or list given to \code{N0} (see examples).}

\item{LWalpha}{A single numeric representing the point estimate of alpha from the length-weight regression on the log10 scale. May be given in a named vector or list given to \code{N0} (see examples).}

\item{LWbeta}{A single numeric representing the point estimate of beta from the length-weight regression on the log10 scale. May be given in a named vector or list given to \code{N0} (see examples).}

\item{maxage}{An single whole number representing maximum age in the population in years. May be given in a named vector or list given to \code{N0} (see examples).}

\item{matchRicker}{A logical that indicates whether the yield function should match that in Ricker (). Defaults to \code{TRUE}. The only reason to changed to \code{FALSE} is to try to match output from FAMS. See the "YPR_FAMSvRICKER" article.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with the following calculated values:
\itemize{
\item \code{yield} is the estimated yield (in g).
\item \code{exploitation} is the exploitation rate.
\item \code{Nharvest} is the number of harvested fish.
\item \code{Ndie} is the number of fish that die of natural deaths.
\item \code{Nt} is the number of fish at time tr (time they become harvestable size).
\item \code{avgwt} is the average weight of fish harvested.
\item \code{avglen} is the average length of fish harvested.
\item \code{tr} is the time for a fish to recruit to a minimum length limit (i.e., time to enter fishery).
\item \code{Fmort} is the instantaneous rate of fishing mortality.
\item \code{Mmort} is the instantaneous rate of natural mortality.
\item \code{Zmort} is the instantaneous rate of total mortality.
\item \code{S} is the (total) annual rate of survival.
}

For convenience the data.frame also contains the model input values (\code{minLL}, \code{cf}, \code{cm}, \code{N0}, \code{Linf}, \code{K}, \code{t0}, \code{LWalpha}, \code{LWbeta}, and \code{maxage}).

The data.frame also contains a \code{notes} value which may contain abbreviations for "issues" that occurred when computing the results and were adjusted for. The possible abbreviates are as follows:

\itemize{
\item \code{minLL>=Linf}: The minimum length limit (minLL) being explored was greater than the given asymptotic mean length (Linf). For the purpose (only) of computing the time at recruitment to the fishery (tr) the Linf was set to minLL+0.1.
\item \code{tr<t0}: The age at recruitment to the fishery (tr) was less than the hypothetical time when the mean length is zero (t0). The fish can't recruit to the fishery prior to having length 0 so tr was set to t0. This also assures that the time it takes to recruit to the fishery is greater than 0.
\item \code{Nt<0}: The number of fish recruiting to the fishery was less than 0. There cannot be negative fish, so Nt was then set to 0.
\item \code{Nt>N0}: The number of fish recruiting to the fishery was more than the number of fish recruited to the populations. Fish cannot be added to the cohort, so Nt was set to N0.
\item \code{Y=Infinite}: The calculated yield (Y) was inifinity, which is impossible and suggests some other propblem. Yield was set to NA.
\item \code{Y<0}: The calculated yield (Y) was negative, which is impossible. Yield was set to 0.
\item \code{Nharv<0}: The calculated number of fish harvested (Nharv) was negative, which is not possible. Number harvested was set to 0.
\item \code{Nharv>Nt}: The calculated number of fish harvested (Nharv) was greater than the number of fish recruiting to the fishery, which is impossible. The number harvested was set to the number recruiting to the fishery.
\item \code{Ndie<0}: The calculated number of fish recruiting to the fishery that died naturally (Ndie) was negative, which is not possible. Number that died was set to 0.
\item \code{Ndie>Nt}: The calculated number of fish recruiting to the fishery that died naturally (Ndie) was greater than the number of fish recruiting to the fishery, which is impossible. The number that died was set to the number recruiting to the fishery.
\item \code{agvglen<minLL}: The average length of harvested fish was less than the given minimum length limit being explored, which is not possible (with only legal harvest). The average length was set to the minimum length limit.

\description{
Estimate yield using the Beverton-Holt Yield-per-Recruit (YPR) model. This main function accepts only single values for conditional fishing mortalitiy (\code{cf}), conditional natural mortality (\code{cm}), and a minimum length limit for harvest (\code{minLL}).
