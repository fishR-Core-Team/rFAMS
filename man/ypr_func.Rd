\arguments{
\item{minLL}{A single numeric representing the minimum length limit for harvest in mm.}

\item{cf}{A single numeric representing conditional fishing mortality.}

\item{cm}{A single numeric representing conditional natural mortality.}

\item{N0}{A single numeric representing the initial number of new recruits entering the fishery OR a vector or list that contains named values for each \code{N0}, \code{Linf}, \code{K}, \code{t0}, \code{LWalpha}, \code{LWbeta}, and \code{maxage}. See examples.}

\item{Linf}{A single numeric representing the point estimate of the asymptotic mean length (L-infinity) from the von Bertalanffy growth model in mm. May be given in a named vector or list given to \code{N0} (see examples).}

\item{K}{A single numeric representing the point estimate of the Brody growth coefficient from the von Bertalanffy growth model. May be given in a named vector or list given to \code{N0} (see examples).}

\item{t0}{A single numeric representing the point estimate of the x-intercept (i.e., theoretical age at a mean length of 0) from the von Bertalanffy growth model. May be given in a named vector or list given to \code{N0} (see examples).}

\item{LWalpha}{A single numeric representing the point estimate of alpha from the length-weight regression on the log10 scale. May be given in a named vector or list given to \code{N0} (see examples).}

\item{LWbeta}{A single numeric representing the point estimate of beta from the length-weight regression on the log10 scale. May be given in a named vector or list given to \code{N0} (see examples).}

\item{maxage}{An single whole number representing maximum age in the population in years. May be given in a named vector or list given to \code{N0} (see examples).}
}
\value{
A data.frame with the following calculated values:
\itemize{
\item \code{yield} is the estimated yield (in g).
\item \code{exploitation} is the exploitation rate.
\item \code{Nharvest} is the number of harvested fish.
\item \code{Ndie} is the number of fish that die of natural deaths.
\item \code{Nt} is the number of fish at time tr (time they become harvestable size).
\item \code{avgwt} is the average weight of fish harvested.
\item \code{avglen} is the average length of fish harvested.
\item \code{tr} is the time for a fish to recruit to a minimum length limit (i.e., time to enter fishery).
\item \code{Fmort} is the instantaneous rate of fishing mortality.
\item \code{Mmort} is the instantaneous rate of natural mortality.
\item \code{Zmort} is the instantaneous rate of total mortality.
\item \code{S} is the (total) annual rate of survival.
}

For convenience the data.frame also contains the model input values (\code{minLL}, \code{cf}, \code{cm}, \code{N0}, \code{Linf}, \code{K}, \code{t0}, \code{LWalpha}, \code{LWbeta}, and \code{maxage}).

\description{
Estimate yield using the Beverton-Holt Yield-per-Recruit (YPR) model. This main function accepts only single values for conditional fishing mortalitiy (\code{cf}), conditional natural mortality (\code{cm}), and a minimum length limit for harvest (\code{minLL}).
