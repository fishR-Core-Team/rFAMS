\usage{
genRecruits(
  method = c("fixed", "uniform", "normal", "StrYC_Nth", "StrYC_randInt"),
  simyears = 50,
  nR = NULL,
  minR = NULL,
  maxR = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{method}{A single string to call the method of generating a vector of recruits. \code{fixed} generates recruitment based on a fixed value for each year of simyears, \code{uniform} generates recruitment based on random values from a uniform distribution for each year of simyears, \code{normal} generates recruitment based on random values from a normal distribution for each year of simyears, \code{StrYC_Nth} generates recruitment based on a strong year class every Nth year, and \code{StrYC_randInt} generates recruitment based on a strong year classes at random intervals.}

\item{simyears}{A single numeric that sets the number of years to simulate recruitment}

\item{nR}{A single numeric that sets the fixed number of recruitment. Used when \code{method="fixed"}.}

\item{minR}{A single numeric that sets the minimum number of recruits during simulations. Used when \code{method="uniform"} or \code{method="normal"}.}

\item{maxR}{A single numeric that sets the maximum number of recruits during simulations. Used when \code{method="uniform"} or \code{method="normal"}.}

\item{meanR}{A single numeric that sets the mean number of recruits. Used when \code{method="normal"}, \code{method="StrYC_Nth"}, or \code{method="StrYC_randInt"}.}

\item{sdR}{A single numeric that sets the standard deviation of number of recruits. Used when \code{method="normal"}.}

\item{nStr}{A single numeric that sets the Nth year that a strong year class will occur. Used when \code{method="StrYC_Nth"}.}

\item{sizeStr}{A single numeric that sets the multiplier for the strong year class relative to meanR. Used when \code{method="StrYC_Nth"}, or \code{method="StrYC_randInt"}.}

\item{avgFreq}{A single numeric that sets the average frequency of a strong year class. Used when \code{method="StrYC_randInt"}.}
}
\value{
A vector that contains the number of recruits for each simulation that can be used directly in the dynamic pool model (e.g., \code{\link{dpmBH_minLL_fixed}}).
}
\description{
This function is used to generate number of recruits across multiple years using different random functions.
}
\examples{
# Genearte recruits based on a fixed number
genRecruits("fixed",nR=50)

# Generate recruits from a uniform distribution bound by 25 and 75
genRecruits("uniform",minR=25,maxR=75)

# Generate recruits based on a normal distribution with a mean of 50,
# standard deviation of 10, and trucated to be between 25 and 75
genRecruits("normal",minR=25,maxR=75,meanR=50,sdR=10)

# Geneate recruits based on a fixed mean recruit number of 50 and a
# strong year class every 5 years with recruits 2 times the mean recruits
genRecruits("StrYC_Nth",meanR=50,sizeStr=2,nStr=5)

# Generate recruits based on a fixed mean recruit number of 50 and a
# strong year class at random intervals of size 2 times the mean recruits
# with the random interval averaging every 5 years.
genRecruits("StrYC_randInt",meanR=50,sizeStr=2,avgFreq=5)
