\value{
A data.frame that contains columns of \code{F} (instantaneous fishing mortality rate) and \code{M}: (instantaneous natural mortality rate) that were derived from the arguments as described in the details.
}
\description{
Create a data.frame of instantaneous fishing (F) and natural (M) mortality rates from user inputs to be used in yield-per-recruit (YPR) simulations in other functions.
}
\details{
The user may enter the mortality values in one of three ways.
\itemize{
\item User may enter values for \code{F} (and optionally \code{Fmax} and \code{Finc}) and \code{M} (and optionally \code{Mmax} and \code{Minc}) to enter instantaneous fishing mortality (F) and natural mortality (M) values.
\item User may enter values for \code{cf} (and optionally \code{cfmax} and \code{cfinc}) and \code{cm} (and optionally \code{cmmax} and \code{cminc}) to enter conditional fishing mortality (cf) and natural mortality (cm) values.
\item User may enter values of \code{Z} (and optionally \code{Zmax} and \code{Zinc}) along with \code{F} (and optionally \code{Fmax} and \code{Finc}) or \code{M} (and optionally \code{Mmax} and \code{Minc}) to enter instantaneous natural mortality (Z) and one of its components (F or M) values.
}

In all instances the values may be entered in a variety of ways, as described below for \code{F},
\itemize{
\item If \code{F} is a single value and \code{Fmax} and \code{Finc} are not used, then a single constant instantaneous fishing mortality value will be used.
\item If \code{F}, \code{Fmax}, and \code{Finc} are all single values, then a sequence of instantaneous fishing mortality values will be created from \code{F} to \code{Fmax} in steps of \code{Finc}.
\item If \code{F} is a vector of values and \code{Fmax} and \code{Finc} are not used, then that vector of instantaneous fishing mortality values will be used.
}

The number of combinations of \code{F} and \code{M} may be less than expected when using \code{Z} as combinations that result in F<0 or M<0 are not included.

\examples{
# Demo of various ways to provide the input values
## Both cf and cm constant
makeMort(cf=0.1,cm=0.2)

## cf varies as a sequence, cm constant
makeMort(cf=0.1,cfmax=0.5,cfinc=0.1,cm=0.2)

## both cf and cm vary as a sequence
makeMort(cf=0.1,cfmax=0.3,cfinc=0.1,cm=0.2,cmmax=0.5,cminc=0.1)

## cf varies by user-provided values, cm constant
makeMort(cf=c(0.1,0.2,0.3),cm=0.2)

## both cf and cm vary by user-provided values
makeMort(cf=c(0.1,0.2,0.3),cm=c(0.2,0.8,0.3))

## Similar examples for F & M values
makeMort(F=0.1,M=0.5)
makeMort(F=0.1,Fmax=0.5,Finc=0.1,M=0.5)
makeMort(F=0.25,Fmax=1,Finc=0.25,M=0.5,Mmax=2,Minc=0.5)
makeMort(F=c(0.25,0.4),M=0.5,Mmax=2,Minc=0.25)

## Similar examples for M & Z values
makeMort(M=0.5,Z=1)
makeMort(M=0.5,Z=0.5,Zmax=2,Zinc=0.25)
makeMort(M=0.5,Mmax=2,Minc=0.25,Z=0.5,Zmax=2,Zinc=0.5)
