\value{
A data.frame that contains the following items
\itemize{
\item \code{cf}: Conditional fishing mortality rate
\item \code{cm}: Conditional natural mortality rate
\item \code{F}: Instantaneous fishing mortality rate
\item \code{M}: Instantaneous naural mortality rate
\item \code{Z}: Instantaneous total mortality rate
\item \code{S}: Annual survival rate
\item \code{A}: Annual mortality rate
\item \code{u}: Annual exploitation rate
}
}
\description{
XXX
}
\details{
The user may enter the mortality values in one of three ways, which must be declared with \code{input} as follows.
\itemize{
\item With \code{input="cfcm"} the user must use \code{cf} (and optionally \code{cfmax} and \code{cfinc}) and \code{cm} (and optionally \code{cmmax} and \code{cminc}) to enter conditional fishing mortality (cf) and natural mortality (cm) values.
\item With \code{input="FM"} the user must use \code{F} (and optionally \code{Fmax} and \code{Finc}) and \code{M} (and optionally \code{Mmax} and \code{Minc}) to enter instantaneous fishing mortality (F) and natural mortality (M) values.
\item With \code{input="MZ"} the user must use \code{M} (and optionally \code{Mmax} and \code{Minc}) and \code{Z} (and optionally \code{Zmax} and \code{Zinc}) to enter instantaneous natural mortality (Z) and total mortality (M) values.
}

In all instances the values may be entered in a variety of ways, as described below for \code{cf},
\itemize{
\item If \code{cf} is a single value and \code{cfmax} and \code{cfinc} are not used, then a single constant conditional fishing mortality value will be used.
\item If \code{cf}, \code{cfmax}, and \code{cfinc} are all single values, then a sequence of conditional fishing mortality values will be created from \code{cf} to \code{cfmax} in steps of \code{cfinc}.
\item If \code{cf} is a vector of values and \code{cfmax} and \code{cfinc} are not used, then that vector of conditional fishing mortality values will be used.
}

\examples{
# Demo of various ways to provide the input values
## Both cf and cm constant
makeMort("cfcm",cf=0.1,cm=0.2)

## cf varies as a sequence, cm constant
makeMort("cfcm",cf=0.1,cfmax=0.5,cfinc=0.1,cm=0.2)

## both cf and cm vary as a sequence
makeMort("cfcm",cf=0.1,cfmax=0.3,cfinc=0.1,cm=0.2,cmmax=0.5,cminc=0.1)

## cf varies by user-provided values, cm constant
makeMort("cfcm",cf=c(0.1,0.2,0.3),cm=0.2)

## both cf and cm vary by user-provided values
makeMort("cfcm",cf=c(0.1,0.2,0.3),cm=c(0.2,0.8,0.3))

## Similar examples for F & M values
makeMort("FM",F=0.1,M=0.5)
makeMort("FM",F=0.1,Fmax=0.5,Finc=0.1,M=0.5)
makeMort("FM",F=0.25,Fmax=1,Finc=0.25,M=0.5,Mmax=2,Minc=0.5)
makeMort("FM",F=c(0.25,0.4),M=0.5,Mmax=2,Minc=0.25)

## Similar examples for F & M values
makeMort("MZ",M=0.5,Z=1)
makeMort("MZ",M=0.5,Z=0.5,Zmax=2,Zinc=0.25)
makeMort("MZ",M=0.5,Mmax=2,Minc=0.25,Z=0.5,Zmax=2,Zinc=0.5)
