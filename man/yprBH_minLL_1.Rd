\title{Simulate expected yield using the Beverton-Holt Yield-per-Recruit model for single input parameters}
\usage{
yprBH_minLL_1(minLL, F, M, lhparms, matchRicker = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{minLL}{A single numeric representing the minimum length limit for harvest in mm.}

\item{F}{A single numeric representing instantaneous fishing mortality.}

\item{M}{A single numeric representing instantaneous natural mortality.}

\item{lhparms}{A named list or vector that contains values for each \code{N0}, \code{Linf}, \code{K}, \code{t0}, \code{LWalpha}, \code{LWbeta}, and \code{maxage}. This is best constructed with \code{\link{makeLH}}.}

\item{matchRicker}{A logical that indicates whether the yield function should match that in Ricker (1975). Defaults to \code{TRUE}. The only reason to changed to \code{FALSE} is to try to match output from FAMS. See the "YPR_FAMSvRICKER" article.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with the following calculated values:
\itemize{
\item \code{yield} is the estimated yield (in g).
\item \code{Nharvest} is the number of harvested fish.
\item \code{Ndie} is the number of fish that die of natural deaths.
\item \code{Nt} is the number of fish at time tr (time they become harvestable size).
\item \code{avgwt} is the average weight of fish harvested.
\item \code{avglen} is the average length of fish harvested.
\item \code{tr} is the time for a fish to recruit to a minimum length limit (i.e., time to enter fishery).
}

The data.frame also contains a \code{notes} value which may contain abbreviations for "issues" that occurred when computing the results and were adjusted for. The possible abbreviates are described in the documentation for \code{\link{yprBH_minLL}}.

\description{
Estimate yield using the Beverton-Holt Yield-per-Recruit (YPR) model. This main function accepts only single values for minimum length limit for harvest (\code{minLL}) and instantaneous fishing (\code{F}) and natural (\code{M}) mortality rates. This function is generally an internal functions for \code{\link{yprBH_minLL}} and will generally not be called by the user.

# Life history parameters to be used below
LH <- makeLH(N0=100,maxage=15,Linf=600,K=0.30,t0=-0.6,LWalpha=-5.453,LWbeta=3.10)

# Mortalities to be used below (single values of each)
morts <- makeMort(cf=0.45,cm=0.25)

# Estimate yield for single values of minLL, cf, and cm
