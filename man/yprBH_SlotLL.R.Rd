\description{
Main wrapper function to estimate yield using the Beverton-Holt YPR model. This main function accepts a range of values for cf, cm, recruitment length, lower slot limit length, and upper slot limit length.

\details{
Best practice is to enter the life history parameters into a list or vector using \code{\link{makeLH}} (rather than directly) as \code{makeLH} performs several sanity checks on the values entered (e.g., ensures Linf>0); i.e.,

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode R">}}\preformatted{# Best practice for entering life history parameter values
LH <- makeLH(N0=100,maxage=15,Linf=600,K=0.30,t0=-0.6,
             LWalpha=-5.453,LWbeta=3.10)

# Works but no checks on the values
LH <- list(N0=100,maxage=15,Linf=600,K=0.30,t0=-0.6,
           LWalpha=-5.453,LWbeta=3.10)
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}
}
\examples{
#Load other required packages for organizing output and plotting
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(metR)

# Life history parameters to be used below
LH <- makeLH(N0=100,tmax=15,Linf=592,K=0.20,t0=-0.3,LWalpha=-5.528,LWbeta=3.273)

#Estimate yield
 Res_1 <- yprBH_SlotLimit(recruitmentTL=200,lowerSL=250,upperSL=325,
                       cf_under=0.25,cf_in=0.6,cf_above=0.15,cmmin=0.3,cmmax=0.55,cminc=0.05,
                       lhparms=LH)
