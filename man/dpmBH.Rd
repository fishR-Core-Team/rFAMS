\title{Main function to simulate expected yield using the Dynamic Pool model for a range of input parameters, including minimum length limits for harvest}
\usage{
dpmBH(
  simyears,
  minLL,
  cf,
  cm,
  rec,
  lhparms,
  matchRicker = FALSE,
  SPR = FALSE,
  SPRdat = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{simyears}{A single numeric for the lower limit of minimum length limit for harvest in mm.}

\item{minLL}{A single numeric representing the minimum length limit for harvest in mm.}

\item{cf}{A matrix of conditional fishing mortality where each row represents a year and each column represents age. Ages are age-0 through maximum age.}

\item{cm}{A matrix of conditional natural mortality where each row represents a year and each column represents age. Ages are age-0 through maximum age.}

\item{rec}{A single numeric representing initial recruitment abundance.}

\item{lhparms}{A named vector or list that contains values for each \code{N0}, \code{tmax}, \code{Linf}, \code{K}, \code{t0}, \code{LWalpha}, and \code{LWbeta}. See \code{\link{makeLH}} for definitions of these life history parameters. Also see details.}

\item{matchRicker}{A logical that indicates whether the yield function should match that in Ricker (). Defaults to \code{TRUE}. The only reason to changed to \code{FALSE} is to try to match output from FAMS. See the "YPR_FAMSvRICKER" article.}

\item{SPR}{A boolean to indicate if spawner per recruit is to be calculated. If true, an object of SPRdat must be provide}

\item{SPRdat}{A named list that contains values for each \code{FLR}, \code{FLRint}, \code{FLRslope}, \code{MatAge}, \code{percF}, and \code{percFSpawn}. See \code{\link{makeSPR}} for definitions of these parameters. Also see details.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with the following calculated values:
\itemize{
\item \code{yield} is the estimated yield (in g).
\item \code{exploitation} is the exploitation rate.
\item \code{Nharvest} is the number of harvested fish.
\item \code{Ndie} is the number of fish that die of natural deaths.
\item \code{Nt} is the number of fish at time tr (time they become harvestable size).
\item \code{avgwt} is the average weight of fish harvested.
\item \code{avglen} is the average length of fish harvested.
\item \code{tr} is the time for a fish to recruit to a minimum length limit (i.e., time to enter fishery).
\item \code{F} is the instantaneous rate of fishing mortality.
\item \code{M} is the instantaneous rate of natural mortality.
\item \code{Z} is the instantaneous rate of total mortality.
\item \code{S} is the (total) annual rate of survival.
}

For convenience the data.frame also contains the model input values (\code{minLL} derived from \code{lengthmin}, \code{lengthmax}, and \code{lengthinc}; \code{cf} derived from \code{cfmin}, \code{cfmax}, and \code{cfinc}; \code{cm} derived from \code{cmmin}, \code{cmmax}, and \code{cminc}; \code{N0}; \code{Linf}; \code{K}; \code{t0}; \code{LWalpha}; \code{LWbeta}; and \code{tmax}).

The data.frame also contains a \code{notes} value which may contain abbreviations for "issues" that occurred when computing the results and were adjusted for. The possible abbreviates are defined under "values" in the documentation for \code{\link{yprBH_func}}.
