\title{Make a list or vector of life history parameters for yield-per-recruit analyses.}
\usage{
makeLH(N0, maxage, Linf, K, t0, LWalpha, LWbeta, restype = c("list", "vector"))
}
\arguments{
\item{N0}{A single numeric that represents the number of fish in the population at the hypothetical age of \code{t0}.}

\item{maxage}{A single whole number that represents maximum age in the population in years.}

\item{Linf}{A single numeric that represents the point estimate of asymptotic mean length from the von Bertalanffy growth model OR an \code{nls} object created from fitting the von Bertalanffy equation to length-at-age data.}

\item{K}{A single numeric that represents the point estimate of the Brody growth coefficient from the von Bertalanffy growth model.}

\item{t0}{A single numeric that represents the point estimate of the x-intercept (i.e., theoretical age at a mean length of 0) from the von Bertalanffy growth model.}

\item{LWalpha}{A single numeric that represents the point estimate of alpha from the length-weight regression on the log10 scale OR an \code{lm} object created from fitting the model to log10-transformed weight-length data.}

\item{LWbeta}{A single numeric that represents the point estimate of beta from the length-weight regression on the log10 scale.}

\item{restype}{A character that indicates the type of output (list or vector) returned by the function.}
}
\value{
A named list or vector (depending on \code{restype}) that contains the given (or extracted) life history parameters values that can be used directly in the yield-per-recruit calculation functions (e.g., \code{\link{ypr_minLL}}).
}
\description{
Efficiently construct either a vector or list that contains the seven life history parameters required for Beverton-Holt yield-per-recruit analyses. The parameters can be given by the user through function arguments. Alternativvely, the von Bertalanffy parameters (\code{Linf}, \code{K}, and \code{t0}) may be extracted from an \code{nls} object created from fitting the von Bertalanffy equation to length-at-age data (object created outside this function). Similarly the log10-transformed weight-length model coefficients may be extracted from an \code{lm} object created from fitting the model to transformed weight-length data (object created outside this function). All parameter values are checked for sanity (e.g., Linf>0).
}
\details{
Use of this function for putting life history parameters into a list or vector is recommended as (i) values for \code{Linf}, \code{K}, \code{t0}, \code{LWalpha}, and \code{LWbeta} can be extracted from objects from appropriate model fitting and (ii) checks for impossible or improbable values for each parameter are performed; i.e.,

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode R">}}\preformatted{# Best practice for entering life history parameter values
LH <- makeLH(N0=100,maxage=15,Linf=600,K=0.30,t0=-0.6,
             LWalpha=-5.453,LWbeta=3.10)

# Works but no checks on the values
LH <- list(N0=100,maxage=15,Linf=600,K=0.30,t0=-0.6,
           LWalpha=-5.453,LWbeta=3.10)
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

If a list is returned then values will be displayed with the number of decimals provided by the user. If a vector is returned then the number of decimals displayed will be the same for each value and will match the value supplied by the user with the most decimals. Thus, a list is preferred as it will be easier to match what was given to what was expected to be given.

\examples{
# ----- Simple examples with explicity arguments for each -------------------
makeLH(N0=100,maxage=15,Linf=500,K=0.3,t0=-0.5,LWalpha=-5.613,LWbeta=3.1)
makeLH(N0=100,maxage=15,Linf=500,K=0.3,t0=-0.5,LWalpha=-5.613,LWbeta=3.1,
       restype="vector")

# ----- Example of extracting values from model fits ------------------------
# N0 and maxage provided as arguments ... Linf, K, and t0 extracted from nls
#   output and LWalpha and LWbeta extracted from lm output. Note that nls
#   and lm output here are just examples of the function, they should be
#   calculated for the same species from the same waterbody, etc.

## get some LVB results (as an example)
data(SpotVA1,package="FSA")
SpotVA1 <- SpotVA1 |>
  dplyr::mutate(tl=tl*25.4)
vb1 <- FSA::vbFuns()
fit1 <- nls(tl~vb1(age,Linf,K,t0),data=SpotVA1,
            start=FSA::vbStarts(tl~age,data=SpotVA1))

## get some LW results (as an example)
data(BluegillLM,package="FSAdata")
BluegillLM <- BluegillLM |>
  dplyr::mutate(logW=log10(wght),
                logL=log10(tl))
fit2 <- lm(logW~logL,data=BluegillLM)

makeLH(N0=100,maxage=15,Linf=fit1,LWalpha=fit2)
