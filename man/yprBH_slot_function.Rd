\arguments{
\item{recruitmentTL}{A numeric representing the minimum length limit for recruiting to the fishery in mm.}

\item{lowerSL}{A numeric representing the length of the lower slot limit in mm.}

\item{upperSL}{A numeric representing the length of the upper slot limit in mm.}

\item{cfunder}{Single value, conditional fishing mortality under the lower slot limit.}

\item{cfin}{Single value, conditional fishing mortality within the lower and upper slot limit.}

\item{cfabove}{Single value, conditional fishing mortality over the upper slot limit.}

\item{cm}{A numeric representing conditional natural mortality}

\item{loi}{A numeric vector for lengths of interest. Used to determine number of fish that reach desired lengths.}

\item{lhparms}{A named vector or list that contains values for each \code{N0}, \code{tmax}, \code{Linf}, \code{K}, \code{t0}, \code{LWalpha}, and \code{LWbeta}. See \code{\link{makeLH}} for definitions of these life history parameters. Also see details.}

\item{matchRicker}{A logical that indicates whether the yield function should match that in Ricker (). Defaults to \code{TRUE}. The only reason to changed to \code{FALSE} is to try to match output from FAMS. See the "YPR_FAMSvRICKER" article.}
